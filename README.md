# Pen Test Toolkit
[Penetration Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test) or ethical hacking is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system and possibly physical security systems associated therewith.  The pen test is performed to evaluate the security of the system.  The test can identify vulnerabilities, including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

### RF-Nano
The RF-Nano is an Arduino Nano combined with an nRF24L01 radio as described [here](https://flowduino.com/2021/08/24/arduino-nano-r3-nrf24l01-rf-nano/).

When power is first applied to the RF-Nano, its red power LED will blink on and off slowly.

The RF-Nano can be programmed via the Arduino IDE: Select the Tools > Board as Arduino Nano.  Then open the blink example sketch and change both delay values to 100 before uploading the code.  After that, the red LED will blink much faster.
